This repo has been initiated with the primary objective of enabling the modeling and simulation of physical systems for academic purposes. It aims to provide a flexible and efficient platform for researchers to explore, analyze, and refine physical models, contributing to the advancement of knowledge in the field of physics and related disciplines. Although the repository is currently in its nascent stages, it aspires to evolve into a comprehensive toolkit that facilitates accurate and insightful simulations of a wide range of physical phenomena.

The development is focused on creating a library of foundational components that will serve as building blocks for modeling physical systems. These components will include mathematical functions, basic simulation algorithms, and data structures necessary for creating simulations.
